## ⚠️ Warning
This project is **outdated** and was **never completed**. While it is open-source and available for exploration, some features may be incomplete or non-functional. Proceed with this understanding in mind.

## Overview
**Fivem Visual Scripting** is a groundbreaking tool designed to help developers visually create Lua scripts for Fivem. By using a drag-and-drop interface with puzzle-like components, users can construct scripts without needing to write code manually. This project is perfect for those who find Lua coding challenging or are looking for a more visual way to develop for Fivem.

## Features
- **Visual Scripting**: Combine visual components like puzzle pieces to generate Lua code for Fivem scripts.
- **Variable Management**: Create and use visual variables across multiple inputs.
- **Control Flow Components**: Includes conditionals (e.g., `if`) and loops (e.g., `while`) for complex logic.
- **Code Export**: Automatically outputs all necessary Lua code based on the visual components assembled.

## Unique Aspects
This project is the first of its kind for Fivem, making it a truly unique and innovative tool for the community. Inspired by Unreal Engine's Blueprints, it offers a fresh and user-friendly approach to Fivem development.
